Semantic change has received increasing attention in empirical Computational Linguistics / NLP in the last few years \cite{tang2018state}. Almost all studies so far have focused on meaning shift in long periods of time --decades to centuries. However, the genesis of meaning shift and the mechanisms that produce it operate at much shorter time spans, ranging
from the online agreement on words meaning in dyadic interactions \cite{brennan1996conceptual} to the rapid spread of new meanings in relatively small communities of people \cite{del2017semantic,del2018road}. \new{This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first exploration of the latter phenomenon in empirical CL/NLP,}\gbt{can we say it like this? else say ``with distributed representations'', or something} that we call \textit{short-term meaning shift}.

\gbt{I change the order of the paragraphs}
We \new{take what seems to us a natural first step, namely, to} analyze the
 behavior of a standard distributional model of semantic change when
 applied to short-term shift.
This kind of model is based on the hypothesis that a change in context of use mirrors a change in meaning.
Our results show that a distributional successfully detects most short-term meaning shifts, but that it overgeneralizes, since some contextual changes do not correspond to a meaning shift.
%\gbt{this is the main result; I would not mention the false negatives cause they are very few.}
We also show that this is a difficulty caused by the nature of short-term meaning shift, and propose to use contextual variability as a means to remedy it.

\gbt{to do: We also should mention that we compare what we find to long-term shift.}

Short-term shift is usually hard to observe in standard language, such
as the language of books or news, which has been the focus of
long-term studies \cite{hamilton2016diachronic,kulkarni2015statistically}, since
%, as is the case for any
%other linguistic innovation, 
it takes a long time for a new meaning to be widely accepted in the standard language. 
% In contrast, 
% new meanings are continuously created and shared in small
% communities of speakers, in which people involved in direct
% communication create and spread those innovations \cite{Clark96,hasan2009}.
We therefore focus on the language produced in an online community of speakers, in which the 
%genesis, spread and 
adoption of new meanings happens at a much faster pace \cite{Clark96,hasan2009}.
%\todo{How about decay? (death of new meanings) -- better not to mention for simplicity?}

% gbt: from the reviewer response (putting this here to give it prominence):
\new{Unlike studies of long-term meaning shift, we cannot rely on material previously gathered by linguists or lexicographers for analysis or evaluation.}
We create a small dataset to enable empirical analysis of short-term
shift.\footnote{Data and code will be made available upon
publication.}
% We analyze the behavior of a standard distributional model of
% semantic change when applied to short-term shift,
% also creating a small dataset for this purpose.

% \marco{Finally, we investigate the role of \textit{contextual variability}, i.e. the extent to which a word tends to occur in a large set of contexts, and show that it provides valuable information which is complementary to the one about cosine distance for the detection of meaning shift on the short term.} 

%but also overgeneralises to words that exhibit an increase in frequency but no meaning shift. This challenges the Distributional Hypothesis itself, which is at the basis of distributional / word embedding approaches to language in Computational Linguistics.

%\marco{moved the paragraph to the conclusion.}
%While preliminary, our investigation opens the way to a new line of
%research within diachronic studies in our field, focusing on
%Short-term Meaning Shift originated and spread in small communities
%of speakers. Besides being of intrinsic theoretical interest, such a
%phenomenon has practical implications for every NLP downstream task
%concerning online communities, as modeling how words change their
%meaning in each community should allow a better understanding of the
%contents produced by its members.

%we study something new: meaning shift in a (relatively) short span. Main contributions:
%manually annotated dataset and analysis of the performance of current models.

%*** Our goal is to assess the performance of NLP system for long term shift detection on a short period. 

%Things to stress: in the nlp field, large work has been carried out on long term meaning shift (actually, when talking about meaning shift, the long term one - 'gay' example - is the only one considered). However, there exists also another kind on of shift, which is on the short term. While the long term meaning shift is observed at the level of general lanaguage, meaning that the new meaning o a word is gradually spread at all the levels of a (national?) community of spekaers, short term changes can not be observed at the same level, because, by their nature, they originate and are shared by smaller communities of speakers. Only if they manage, at some point, to go beyond that community and spread in other, they can be modelled as long term shifts (in the same way of 'gay'). So, in a way, exploring short term changes means looking at the genesis of the ones investigated in the nlp field up to know.

%We need to say which are the kind of shifts observed, and for this we need some theoretical framework. In any case, we have for sure memes,  referential phenomena and some kind of metaphorical process. 

%we need to say that we want also to observe how model for long term meaning shift work on this dataset.
