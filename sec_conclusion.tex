The goal of this preliminary study was to bring to the attention of the NLP community short-term meaning shift, an under-researched problem in the field. 
% gbt: in a short paper we don't need a recap
% Our contribution is twofold: (i) we create and make available a dataset for short-term meaning shift manually annotated by experts; (ii) we test the performance of a standard model for diachronic meaning shift on such a dataset, providing a detailed error analysis that provides insights into the phenomenon.
We hope that it will spark further research into a phenomenon which, besides being of theoretical interest, has potential practical implications for NLP downstream tasks concerned with user-generated language.
% gbt: why did you remove this last sentence? Without it it sounds too vague to me
% as modeling how words meaning rapidly change in communities would allow to better understand what their members say.
