The goal of this initial study was to bring to the attention of the NLP community {\bf short-term meaning shift}, an under-studied problem in the field. 
Our hope is that it will spark further research into a phenomenon which, besides being of theoretical interest, has potential practical implications for NLP downstream tasks concerned with user-generated language, as modeling how word meanings rapidly change in communities would allow a better understanding of what their members say.
Future research should experiment with other datasets (reddits from other domains, other online communities) and also alternative models that address the challenges described here.
