The goal of this preliminary study was to bring to the attention of the NLP community short-term meaning shift, an under-studied problem in the field. 
\marco{While we are aware of the fact that the dataset used in this work does not allow to draw general conclusions about the phenomenon at hand, we expect it to arise in other communities too. This could be assessed by extending the current dataset, including data from different communities.}
Our hope is that current work will spark further research into a phenomenon which, besides being of theoretical interest, has potential practical implications for NLP downstream tasks concerned with user-generated language, as modeling how word meanings rapidly change in communities would allow a better understanding of what their members say.

%% gbt: in a short paper we don't need a recap
%% Our contribution is twofold: (i) we create and make available a dataset for short-term meaning shift manually annotated by experts; (ii) we test the performance of a standard model for diachronic meaning shift on such a dataset, providing a detailed error analysis that provides insights into the phenomenon.
