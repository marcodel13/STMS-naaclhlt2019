\begin{abstract}
We present the first exploration of meaning shift over short periods of time in online communities using distributional representations. We create a small annotated dataset and use it to assess the performance of a standard model for meaning shift detection on short-term meaning shift. We find that the model has problems distinguishing meaning shift from referential phenomena, and propose a measure of contextual variability to remedy this.

%\section{Further details on Data and Model}

%
%We downloaded Reddit data using the Python package Praw: \url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/praw/}.

%The model was implemented using the Python package Gensim: \url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gensim/}.


\section{Further details on Evaluation Dataset}
\label{sec:further_details_data_model}

For our experiment, we considered content words only, which we identified by using the external list of common words available at \url{https://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp}.

Three words were discarded from the initial list after analysis of the redditor data: `discord' and `owls' due to the homonymy with proper names not detected during survey's implementation; `tracking' because the chosen examples clearly mislead the judgements of the redditors.

As detailed in the main paper, 26 members of r/LiverpoolFC participated in the survey, and each word received on average 8.8 judgements. We computed inter-annotator agreement as Krippendorff's alpha, and obtained $\alpha$ = 0.58, a relatively low value but common in semantic tasks \cite{artstein2008inter}.

The results of the annotation validate our initial word sampling procedure:

\begin{itemize}
\item  the words that present a significant increase in frequency and were annotated as
meaning shift by us received an average shift annotation of 0.72 ($\pm$ 0.15);
\item the words that present a
significant increase in frequency but that were \emph{not} annotated as
meaning shift by us received an average shift annotation of  0.15 ($\pm$ 0.16);
\item the words that keep a constant frequency between $t_1$ and $t_2$, and we don't consider examples of meaning shift, got 0.07 ($\pm$ 0.12).
\end{itemize}
